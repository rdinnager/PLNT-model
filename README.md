PLNT-model
==========

Phylogenetic Latent Niche Trait (PLNT) Model for modeling (and testing?) phylogenetic structure in environmental filtering and competitive interactions simultaneously. Uses Baysian MCMC in Stan software to fit the model. Now am porting this model to amazing filzbach software from Microsoft Research (http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/cambridge/groups/science/tools/filzbach/filzbach.htm), written by Drew Purves and Vassily Lyutsarev. Using filzbach I can finally add competition in the way I want to!!
