This vignette shows how I fit a Phylogenetic Latent Niche Trait model on a fish dataset that was kindly provided to me by Mattew Helmus.

The first step is to load in the fish dataset. This data consists of the presence or absence of 11 sunfish species measured in 890 lakes through-out "" United States. Additionally there is a phylogenetic tree containing all of these sunfish, and also some environmental data for each lake that we won't make use of initially.

```{r load data,cache=TRUE}
fishPA <- read.csv("D:/Users/Dinnage/Projects/PLNT-model/data/HelmusFishPA.csv")
head(fishPA)
```

This is the likelihood function for the model:

```{r, cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE, comment=""}
source("D:/Users/Dinnage/Projects/PLNT-model/R/PLNT-LLmodel.R")
ll.PLNT
```
